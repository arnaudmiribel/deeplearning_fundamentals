# Get started

First create the proper Anaconda environment using :

`conda env create -f deepenv.yml`

This will normally install more than necessary packages for you that concern either deep learning (Keras, Tensorflow) or regular packages for data science (pandas, sklearn, ...).

Usually, the environment we like to prototype models using Python is Jupyter Notebooks. It's an interactive python session with a great interface. You can run this using :

`jupyter notebook`

And it should open a web browser on a locally hosted server :-)

Now you can go over the directory `notebooks/` and play around with the Jupyter Notebooks.
