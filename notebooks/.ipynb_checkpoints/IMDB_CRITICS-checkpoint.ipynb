      "<START> bride of chucky starts late one night as officer bob bailey vince sneaks into the evidence room at his police station amongst all the horror film in joke props he steals the remains of the chucky doll that serial killer charles lee ray possessed way back in the original child's play 1988 he drives the remains to an isolated area where ray's ex girlfriend tiffany jennifer tilly slashes bailey's throat takes the remains back to her trailer there tiffany stitches staples chucky voiced by brad dourif back together again using a 'voodoo for book brings him back to murderous life thing don't go as tiffany had hoped chucky turns out not to be the man of her dreams after all so she locks him in a play pen at which chucky is less than happy while tiffany takes a bath chucky escapes electrocutes her using that book brings her back to life in the shape of a female doll dressed as a bride neither want to be stuck in plastic bodies have to work together to get to a cemetery in new jersey where ray's natural body had been buried with the amulet needed to switch their spirits back into human bodies the bodies of tiffany's neighbour jesse nick his girlfriend jade katherine heigl who are both on the run from corrupt uncle chief of police warren kincaid john ritter will do nicely br br directed by ronny yu i love bride of chucky the script by don mancini is great fun very fast moving highly entertaining references plenty of other horror film with good affection from the opening sequence where we see jason voorhees hockey mask from the friday the 13th films freddy krueger's razor blade glove from the a nightmare on elm street series michael myers mask from the halloween franchise to the clips used from bride of frankenstein 1935 when it virtually recreates the same scene bride of chucky never takes itself seriously which is just as well there are lots of one liners self referential gags that scream 1996 made trendy a few years earlier it doesn't seem afraid to poke fun at itself the horror genre in general i love the scene when jesse jade are having a clich챕d slushy romantic conversation that chucky hears he makes funny derogatory comments gestures throughout that's not to say that there isn't a damn good film in there as well because there most certainly is director yu manages to create good atmosphere a real sense of fun both human plastic sets of characters are likable shine as each pair suffer their own sets of domestic problems that the trail of corpses that they are leaving behind would obviously cause technically bride of chucky is great for the most part has that big budget polish about it at about 25 000 000 i should hope so the only thing that i will say is that some of the puppet effects by kevin are a little stiff unconvincing i can't remember any cgi scenes in bride of chucky either thankfully the film doesn't neglect the blood gore with a cool slit throat nails blasted into someone's face in presumably a hellraiser 1987 homage people impaled on shards of glass someone being obliterated by a huge truck a ripped off lip piercing various stabbings gunshots the acting is pretty good dourif as chucky is very funny as he spouts the one liners out i also like the scenes with tiffany at the beginning find her very sexy when she's wearing all that fetish gear i can't be the only one surely i personally think bride of chucky is a fantastic film total entertainment from start to finish great humour horror in equal measure at only 85 minutes long it never becomes boring or dull a personal favourite of mine watch it as soon as you can\n",

      "<START> this movie has good intentions at least in the message don't be afraid no matter how tough it can be fear will kill you in the end it's a good message but the container is so flawed that the message gets squashed by bad acting complete lack of credibility in the feelings dialog that's delivered as if it were read out loud stereotypes instead of breathing living people br br it abuses from effects such as slow motion to compensate for a complete lack of credibility in the acting and thus a lack of emotional force br br the suicidal part of it still reminds me of a low budget film from the pre 90s when lesbians seemed to have at least on celluloid an utter incapacity of live good happy lives and a tendency to get caught in over the top dramas that often involved separation death or prison br br had it focused on the rewards of living life according to how we feel it and not according to how others think we should live it it would have being less dramatic more inspiring but it doesn't it focuses of pain on loss and leaves the message at just a theoretical ideal br br i can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection br br if you're looking for a really good movie that talks about overcoming fear and daring to live what you feel go back to the magnificent desert hearts even better read the novel\n",

      "<START> it's nice that these three young directors have produced films with good productions values and decent acting there's some good work here br br unfortunately they suffer from what much of modern gay cinema recycled plots too familiar devices i have seen the pool setting way too many times in gay male films and hackneyed scripts most egregious of all is dorothy whose preposterous premise is that a cute young guy will have trouble getting laid in nyc due to a shortage of identifiable gay guys in his vicinity br br in terms of cinema these shorts play like tacky little gay afterschool specials not a lot of imagination in their writing or execution basically they follow a point and shoot shot reaction shot master shot convention which becomes painfully dull after five or so minutes there's hope for queer cinema in the works of todd haynes sadie benning and the late great marlon riggs but not here these films are incredibly middlebrow singularly whitebread and their values basically pander to a gay bourgeois sensibility which is probably why they play so well at gay film festivals\n",
